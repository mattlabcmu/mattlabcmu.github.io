It's been an exciting week at the Matt Lab! We just released a new paper, "Action-Informed Estimation and Planning: Clearing Clutter on Staircases via Quadrupedal Pedipulation" and Dr. Travers had the honor of presenting it to a fantastic audience at NVIDIA GTC 2025.
To celebrate the new research (and Halloween!), we created a short video showing our system in action. We set our Spot robot on a mission to get its favorite 'candy' (batteries!), but a 'haunted' staircase stood in its way.

Report from GTC 2025
Matt's talk, "Scalable Field Robot Autonomy: Belief in Omniverse for Sim-Real-Sim Policies," focused on how to enable sim-to-real transfer for robots operating in unknown and unstructured human environments. The talk was well-received, and it was great to connect with other researchers and leaders in the field. We're excited about the fantastic discussions and feedback we received.

We're proud of this work and excited about the path forward.
